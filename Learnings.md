# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run applications with containers. Containers allow you to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Use Cases

- **Simplified Configuration:** Docker allows you to configure your application once and run it anywhere.
- **Code Pipeline Management:** Docker can be used to manage and streamline the development, testing, and deployment of applications.
- **Developer Productivity:** Docker containers can be started and stopped quickly, which speeds up the development process.
- **Isolation:** Each container runs in its own isolated environment, which helps in avoiding conflicts between different applications.
